            <p>After the great Zagreb earthquake of 9 November 1880, the sporadic earthquake
                research efforts evolve into systematic ones. Immediately after the earthquake, the
                Yugoslav Academy of Science and Arts in Zagreb established the “Committee for
                observation of earthquake-related phenomena”. The main task of the Committee
                was to study Croatian earthquakes and methodically collect all related data. In the first
                volume of its Papers, the Academy published the extensive report on the Zagreb
                earthquake (Torbar, 1882), where the phenomena related to that event are not only
                described, but also explained. The Academy’s Committee later also collected and
                published all available information on the Croatian earthquakes for the period
                361–1906. This data set was used as solid basis for scientific study of the natural
                phenomenon (Kišpatić, 1891, 1892, 1895).
                In January 1892, Andrija Mohorovičić became the director of the Meteorological
                Observatory in Zagreb (later Geophysical Institute). In 1893 he initiated systematic
                collection of earthquake related data. These data were regulary published since
                1906 in the Seismic reports. Following the strong earthquake of 17 December 1901
                near Zagreb, Kišpatić and Mohorovičić made every effort to have a seismic station
                set up in Zagreb. After the first seismoscopes and seismographs were obtained in
                the beginning of the 20th century, Mohorovičić realized the importance of accurate
                time-keeping. He therefore initiated regular observation of times of passage stars
                through the local meridian, thus founding the Croatian time service.
                The first catalogue compilation was initiated within the framework of the
                UNDP/UNESCO project “Survey of the seismicity of the Balkan region” (Shebalin
                et al., 1974). The resulting catalogue was published in two volumes (Part I – earthquakes in the period 1901–1970; Part II – earthquakes before 1901). Its subset consisting of earthquakes on the Croatian territory formed a nucleus of the CEC. It has
                been revised (e.g. Herak et al., 1996) and supplemented for the years after 1970
                (e.g. Herak et al., 1988a, b, 1991; Herak, 1989; Herak and Cabor, 1989; Markušić
                et al., 1990, 1993, 1998; Ivančić et al, 2001/02, 2006). As a rule, new entries were
                added to the catalogue with a delay of 1–2 years, which could be used to collect
                relevant data and relocate the earthquakes.
                For historical earthquakes only macroseismic information was used. In the early
                years of 20th century, instrumental data were rare and available only for strong
                earthquakes. For that period, in the cases when it was impossible to obtain a reliable
                instrumental, locations of the epicentres were determined also on the basis of macroseismic data.

            <p>The Croatian area which is part of the Alpine–Mediterranean seismic region,
                comprises several geotectonic units. The dominant ones are the Pannonian Basin to
                the north, Eastern Alps, the Dinarides, the Dinarides–Adriatic Platform transition
                zone and the Adriatic Platform itself. The seismicity is unevenly distributed albeit
                most earthquakes occur in the coastal area of the country – the Dinarides. This is
                commonly explained by the ongoing collision between the Adriatic Platform and the
                Dinarides (e.g. Aljinović et al., 1984; Anderson and Jackson, 1987; Pribičević et al.,
                2002; Nocquet and Calais, 2004; Kotzev et al., 2006). The seismogenic faults here
                are mostly reverse ones, and the tectonic movements have predominantly tangential
                components. The Pannonian Basin exhibits typical intraplate seismicity characterized

            <p>The first seismological station on Croatian territory was opened in Pula in 1900,
                equipped at first with a Vicentini, and afterwards also with Conrad and Wiechert
                seismographs. The station was closed in 1918, after the collapse of the Austro–
                Hungarian empire. It is not known what happened to the instruments and the
                seismogram archive.
                The Zagreb (ZAG) seismological station was founded when the first seismological
                instrument (the Agamemnone electrical seismoscope) was acquired by the
                Academy in 1901. At the conference of directors of meteorological institutes, held
                in Innsbruck in 1905, Dr. Andrija Mohorovičić, head of Meteorological Institute in
                Zagreb, asked Dr. Konkoly from Budapest to lend him one of the Vicentini seismo-
                graphs. This instrument was installed in basement of the Geophysical Institute in
                Zagreb on April 6, 1906. It was operational for 18 years. Unsatisfied with the
                instrument’s performance, Mohorovičić purchased the Wiechert seismograph with
                a mass of 80 kg that recorded horizontal ground motion and installed it in Zagreb
                in 1908. Soon afterwards, in 1909, a new horizontal instrument was obtained with
                a mass of 1,000 kg. The vertical Wiechert instrument (1,200 kg) was acquired in
                1932. These seismographs operated with almost no interruptions until 1983 when
                they were moved to the Institute’s new location in Horvatovac, Zagreb. These seis-
                mographs have recently been restored and are now in an operating condition.
                Electromagnetic seismographs (Sprengnether, SKM-3, Vegik) were obtained in
                early 1970s, within the framework of the UNESCO project “Survey of the seismicity
                of the Balkan region”. At that time, the strong-motion network was installed too.
                The new instruments were used to open new permanent stations Puntijarka (PTJ,
                1972), Hvar (HVAR, 1973), Dubrovnik (DBK, 1986) and Rijeka (RIY, 1988). In
                addition to permanent stations, a number of temporary ones were installed all over
                Croatian territory, some of which are still active.
                The first 16-bit digital instrument was installed in Zagreb in 1989. The modern
                Croatian seismic network is based on seven broad-band seismometers with 24-bit
                digitizers, which were obtained in 1999. At this time, ten BB seismometers operate
                on Croatian territory.
