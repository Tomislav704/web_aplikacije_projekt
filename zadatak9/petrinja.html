                <h3>Seven people were confirmed dead, while 26 others were injured, with six having serious injuries</h3>
                <p>At approximately 12:20 PM CET (11:20 UTC) on 29 December 2020, an earthquake of magnitude 6.4 Mw (6.2 ML) hit the Sisak-Moslavina County, Croatia, with an epicenter located in Strašnik, a village 3 km (1.9 mi) west-southwest of Petrinja.[1] The maximum felt intensity was estimated at VIII (Heavily damaging) to IX (Destructive) on the European macroseismic scale.[2] Before this event there were three foreshocks, the strongest of which had a magnitude of 5.2 Mw on the day before. The earthquake was followed by numerous aftershocks, the strongest of which had a magnitude of 4.9 Mw.

                    Seven people were confirmed dead, while 26 others were injured, with six having serious injuries. Initial reports show many buildings destroyed in Petrinja.[5] The mayor of Petrinja Darinko Dumbović said that half of the town has been destroyed.[6][7][8][9]

                    The earthquake was felt throughout northern Croatia, as well as in large parts of Slovenia, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Hungary, Slovakia, and Italy, as well as in some parts of Montenegro, Germany, and the Czech Republic</p>
                <p>The epicenter is located in a hilly area just south of the Kupa-Sava alluvial plain, with the Zrinska gora mountain and the rest of the Dinaric Alps to the south.

                    The Pokuplje seismic area follows the Kupa river valley from Karlovac to Sisak. This area has been affected by several historical earthquakes, the best known being the major event in 1909 with the epicenter near Pokupsko, with aftershocks that continued into 1910. It had a maximum felt intensity of VIII on the MCS scale. This seismicity has been associated with reactivation of northwest–southeast trending normal faults that form the southwestern boundary of the Pannonian Basin.[10][11]

                    The last earthquake on the territory of Croatia that had a magnitude of 6.0 ML was in Ston in 1996. In 1969, the fault system which extends from Jastrebarsko over this area towards Banja Luka had a 6.6 ML earthquake which hit the latter city, and that one was also preceded by significant foreshocks one day earlier. In 1880, a 6.3 ML struck north-east of Zagreb. In March 2020, a 5.5 ML earthquake struck the city of Zagreb.[12]</p>

                    The earthquake had a magnitude of 6.4 Mw  and a depth of 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) according to Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS)[1] and European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC),[13] while the Seismological Survey of Croatia recorded 6.2 ML. The maximum felt intensity was VIII (heavily damaging) to IX (destructive) on the European macroseismic scale (EMS)[2] and IX (violent) on the Modified Mercalli intensity scale (MMI).

                    The location and depth of this event show that it was an intraplate earthquake that occurred as a result of shallow strike-slip faulting within the Eurasian Plate. The calculated focal mechanism for the event indicates that rupture occurred on a nearly vertical fault striking either to the southeast or southwest.[1]

                    The Croatian Seismological Survey estimated the earthquake's epicentre at 45°24′0.72″N 16°13′7.32″E (45.4002, 16.2187),[3][4] located near the village of Strašnik, within the town of Petrinja.[14]</p>
                <p>The town of Petrinja was the worst affected, with many buildings collapsed and a major power outage.[5] Damage and power outages were also reported in Dvor, Glina, Gvozd, Hrvatska Kostajnica, Kutina, Sisak, Sunja, Topusko, Velika Gorica, and Zagreb, as well as the neighbouring countries Bosnia and Herzegovina and Slovenia.</p>
